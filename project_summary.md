## Description

How would an android paint? Would it focus on the same details a human would? This project aims to explore the space of possiblities of the painting process by using software.

A virtual canvas is shown to the viewer. Brushstrokes appear, one by one. Behind the scenes, an artificial painter is painting what it sees through a webcam. As people move around it changes. They can also use their phones or a computer to tell the artificial painter to change its style.
