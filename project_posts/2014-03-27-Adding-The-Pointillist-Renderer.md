Once I had the Whistler renderer working and configurable, I thought it would be worthwhile to try if I could integrate another renderer into the Python program.

I had written a pointillist style renderer before but it worked differently to Whistler and it wasn't incremental. So I began rewriting it, only this time to use the Whistler module as a base for it, that way integrating it into the main Python program shouldn't be that difficult.

After quite a few errors and some strange bugs I finally got it to work. The Python program also knows if the config has changed to pointllist and renders differently, on the fly! It was actually quite fun to play with the different options, mixing them to see what effect it would have.

There are definitely a lot of possibilities in being able to alter/change how the renderer works and trying different permutations is bound to also influence how the painting progresses too.
